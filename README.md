--Program Description--

The GPC Power Monitoring and Control System is a program designed to autonomously route and monitor power distribution for all of GPC's power grid. The system was built to handle power outages within the grid by dynamically calculating the shortest path from all houses to available power sources, and the associated costs. It is also focused on minimizing costs by taking into account power consumption and transmission costs when calculating power distribution paths. The program was designed to be a simple, user friendly experience providing all relevant, up-to-date information at the click of a button.
